## 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms---------------------------------------
## TYPE 1. SUPERVISED Learning
# algorithm consist of a Dependent variable which is predicted from a given set of Independent variables.
# training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
# e.g. Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.

## TYPE 2. UNSUPERVISED Learning
# for this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate.
# used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
# e.g. Apriori algorithm, K-means.

## TYPE 3. REINFORCEMENT Learning
# for this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions.
# the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error.
# e.g.Markov Decision Process

## List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms ----------------------------------
#  These algorithms can be applied to almost any data problem.
    #1.Linear Regression
    #2.Logistic Regression

    #4.SVM: Support Vector Machine
    #5.Naive Bayes
    #6.kNN
    #7.K-Means
    #8.Random Forest
    #9.Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
    #10.Gradient Boosting algorithms- (GBM, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
